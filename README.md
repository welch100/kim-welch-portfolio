# Kim Welch – Data Analytics & Engineering Portfolio

Welcome!  
This repository showcases selected projects and work samples highlighting my skills in **data engineering**, **analytics**, **SQL**, **Python**, **Alteryx**, and **data visualization**.  
These examples demonstrate my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights and deliver end-to-end analytical solutions.

## 📊 Interactive Dashboards

**Tableau Public Portfolio**  
View my interactive dashboards here: [Tableau Public – Kim Welch](YOUR_TABLEAU_PUBLIC_LINK)  

This portfolio contains interactive dashboards created during graduate coursework and independent projects, focusing on:
- Data storytelling and visual analytics  
- KPI tracking and monitoring  
- Business performance insights  

In my professional role, I have developed additional dashboards for enterprise use. Due to the proprietary and sensitive nature of this work, I have not included them in their entirety. However, I have provided a few screenshots within this portfolio (with all sensitive information fully redacted) to demonstrate my professional design style, layout approach, and storytelling methodology.

## 🖼️ Work Sample Dashboards (Redacted)

These are screenshots of dashboards I have designed and developed in a professional setting.  
Proprietary data has been **fully anonymized/redacted** while preserving:
- Layout and design approach
- Metric hierarchy and prioritization
- Storytelling methodology

*(`images/` folder contains PNG/JPEG files of redacted dashboards.)*
